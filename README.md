## Yigit Can H.

**Sr. Full-Stack Developer** at **Varien Software Inc.** · Izmir, Turkey

---

I run a software agency with over 15 years in the industry. My daily work sits at the intersection of PHP backends, React Native mobile apps, and the tooling that ties them together. When something I need doesn't exist, I build it — most of my open source work comes from exactly that habit.

Lately I've been spending serious time on AI-assisted development workflows. Not as a novelty, but as a core part of how I ship production code. I write hooks, prompt pipelines, and orchestration layers that sit on top of LLM tooling — because the gap between "demo" and "daily driver" is where the real work happens.

I've delivered projects for municipal governments, healthcare groups, logistics platforms, and dozens of SMBs across Turkey. The stack changes, the problems stay interesting.
